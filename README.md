# dw-boxgrinder-tarball-platform-plugin

This BoxGrinder platform plugin generates a compressed tarball which can be uploaded 
to a host with a minimal OS install. When extracted the payload will place the files
from your "files:" section into the appropriate directories and will place 
a script in the root directory which can install all of your "packages:" and
execute your "post: base:" commands. 

In other words, it provides a way to customise an existing minimal OS install 
according to a BoxGrinder appliance definition. This can be useful eg: when your 
test environment is virtualised but parts of your production/staging environment are not,
or if your VM hosting providers only allow pre-configured images to be used
and you can't build your hosted images from scratch.

## Installation

    gem install dw-boxgrinder-tarball-platform-plugin

## Usage

    boxgrinder-build your_appliance.appl -p tarball -l dw-boxgrinder-tarball-platform-plugin
    
After the build has finished, you'll find the payload archive under 
build/appliances/<arch>/<os>/<version>/<appliance-name>/<appliance_version>/tarball-plugin/<appliance-name>.tgz

Copy this file into the root directory of you target host, untar it (tar -zxvf your_appliance.tgz)
and run the "install.sh" file (sh install.sh).

## Known Issues and Limitations

This plugin currently only works when BoxGrinder is executed from within the directory 
containing your .appl file(s) (otherwise the files in your "files:" section won't 
be found). A fix for that is being investigated.

This plugin does not support ephemeral repositories and will simply ignore them when adding
repos to the tarball payload. Any RPMs from ephemeral repos will cause the install_rpms.sh 
script in the tarball payload to fail.

If you have platform-specific "post" instructions they will be ignored by this plugin.
We have no need for such functionality, though pull requests to implement it would be welcomed.
